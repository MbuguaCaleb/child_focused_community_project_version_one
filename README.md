**Project Description**

```
Under this CFCT program, FH would like to maintain an updated
record of each household. Each household must include a
household head, as well as additional members, including
sponsored children. In most cases, a sponsor can support one
or several children in different households. The profile of a
sponsored child should include their personal information
(bio data) as well as a recent photo of them. This photo is
vital to the sponsor, who needs it to identify the child they
are supporting and also keep track of their physical development,
therefore it needs to be updated every year.

```
